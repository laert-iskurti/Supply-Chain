The Beer Game is a web-based game which simulates a supply chain model in the real world. It reflects a role-
play simulation where several participants play with each-other. The game represents a supply chain with a
non-coordinated process where problems arise due to lack of information sharing. The participants of the game
are assigned a role in the supply chain which can be the Factory, Distributor, Wholesaler, Retailer. Throughout
the game, each participant is making orders and receiving shipments with aim to fulfill the successorâ€™s demand.
Each group can highly influence the entire supply chain by ordering too much or too little which can lead to
a bullwhip effect. Therefore, the order taking of a group also highly depends on decisions of the other groups.
More information regarding the game can be found [here](http://scgames.bauer.uh.edu/). We have made an implementation of this game with Django, Html, Bootstrap.



# Description
### User Stories:
* User (instructor/student) can register, login. Authentication and authorization implemented.
* User (instructor/student) can create and start games, by specifying the roles, the players, and other settings of the games.
* User (instructor/student) can delete, and update games (even while the game is being played)
* Student can play more than one game. For each game, every information needed is displayed (plots, tables, orders from other players).
* Each user (student/instructor) can view a list of the games he/she has created and those he/she is playing.
* The admin of the game can monitor the game (view plots, total cost etc.)
* At the end of the game, each user can view the game statistics ( all the plots, tables).

### Project Structure
This Django project contains only one app, which is called 'game'.

# Setup
1. Install **MySQL** (if not currently installed)
2. All the dependencies of this project can be found in requirements.txt file. In order to install them just run the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If one of the dependencies cannot be installed, try to install them with pip.\
Note: More information installing **mysql-client** (Windows/Linux) if the above command did not work can be found [here](https://medium.com/@omaraamir19966/connect-django-with-mysql-database-f946d0f6f9e3).

3. After installation create a new database on Mysql, and include the information regarding it in /mysite/settings.py in the DATABASES section. More information can be found in the link given above.

4. Make migrations (construction of the database)
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

```
5. Run the server
```
python manage.py runserver

```
6. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ and enjoy the game!

For a better testing of the game:
- Create 5 users (4 students, 1 instructor), signup, login
- Login in with the instructor and create some games (more than 1), including the students you created, having different options (wholesaler, distributor present/not present). Recommended: Nr of weeks should not be too large, and information delay should be small (to notice the game logic better)
- Start the games, at the main page, by clicking the link start game.
- For testing purposes, each round lasts only 5 minutes. These can be changed at /views/crudGame.py. You have a variable at top, called round_length. If you want hours, days,weeks, instead of minutes you can change that at *startGame* view found in the same file.
- Login in with the users created and play all the games concurrently. Do that for all the users (keep in mind the 5 minute length of the round).
- You can notice that the logic of the game is implemented (order placed by a role, becomes a demand to another one, outgoing shipment becomes incoming shipment to the other role of the same game)
- You can view the plots, the tables, or monitor the game (through the admin of the game).

# Testing
After doing the steps described in setup, the application can be tested with the command (in the root directory):
```
python manage.py test game
```
